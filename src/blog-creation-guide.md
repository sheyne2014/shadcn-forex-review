## Database Integration Process

### Setting Up Environment Variables
1. Ensure the following variables are in your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://imndrogsolkrupmuzikd.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImltbmRyb2dzb2xrcnVwbXV6aWtkIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzI4NjkyMiwiZXhwIjoyMDU4ODYyOTIyfQ.HfXVNcxF7sqOsaclotpm8vR8lF_tGk-WGZvQik-8GRM
   ```

### Blog Post Database Schema
The `blog_posts` table in Supabase stores all blog content. The script will try to identify available columns and adapt accordingly, but at minimum, the table should have:
- `id`: UUID, primary key
- `title`: String, blog post title
- `content`: Text, full MDX content

Additional columns that will be used if available:
- `slug`: URL-friendly version of title
- `description`: Text, meta description
- `published_at`: Timestamp, publication date
- `author`: String, author name
- `featured_image`: String, URL to featured image

### Automated Blog Publishing Process

After creating a new blog post in the `src/app/blog/` directory, follow these steps to add it to the Supabase database:

1. **Create the blog post file** in the `src/app/blog/` directory with proper frontmatter metadata
   - Filename should be SEO-friendly with keywords and hyphens
   - Include all required metadata (title, description, date, etc.)

2. **Run the database import script**:
   
   For Windows:
   ```powershell
   # Default blog post (forex trading mistakes)
   npm run add-blog-post
   
   # Specific blog post
   npm run add-blog-post "src/app/blog/your-blog-post-file.mdx"
   ```
   
   For macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable (first time only)
   chmod +x add-blog-to-db.sh
   
   # Run for default blog post
   ./add-blog-to-db.sh
   
   # Run for a specific blog post
   ./add-blog-to-db.sh src/app/blog/your-blog-post-file.mdx
   ```

3. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard** that the blog post has been added correctly:
   - Check title and content are properly stored
   - Confirm other metadata has been saved if supported by the table schema

### Automatic Database Updates

The database import script is designed to be flexible and will adapt to your `blog_posts` table structure:

1. It will first attempt to add the blog post with all metadata fields
2. If any fields cause errors, it will fall back to a more minimal approach
3. At minimum, it will try to insert just the title if other fields aren't supported

If you need to modify the database schema later, you can alter the table structure in Supabase, and the script will automatically detect and use the new columns.

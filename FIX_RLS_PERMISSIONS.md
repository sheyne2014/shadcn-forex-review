# Fix for "No brokers found" Issue

## Root Cause

We've diagnosed the issue with brokers not showing up on the page. The problem is related to **Row Level Security (RLS)** in Supabase, which is preventing the frontend from reading the broker data.

Our diagnostics confirmed that:
1. Brokers exist in the database (180+ records)
2. The brokers table is properly structured
3. The frontend code is correctly trying to fetch and display brokers
4. But RLS policies are preventing public/anonymous access to the brokers table

## Solution

Follow these steps to fix the issue:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/
2. Select your project
3. Go to the "SQL Editor" section in the left sidebar
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy and paste the following SQL code:

```sql
-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for the brokers table
ALTER TABLE brokers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy to allow public read access to all broker records
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to brokers" 
  ON brokers 
  FOR SELECT 
  TO authenticated, anon 
  USING (true);

-- Verify the policy was created
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'brokers';
```

6. Click "Run" to execute the SQL
7. Refresh your website - the brokers should now appear!

## Explanation

Supabase uses Row Level Security to control access to your database tables. By default, tables with RLS enabled are locked down and no access is allowed unless explicitly granted through policies.

The SQL above:
1. Ensures RLS is enabled on the brokers table
2. Creates a policy that allows both authenticated users and anonymous visitors to read (SELECT) broker records
3. Verifies the policy was created

## Testing

To verify the fix worked:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/brokers 
2. You should now see a list of brokers instead of "No brokers found"
3. Try clicking on the different tabs (Forex, Crypto, etc.) to see filtered broker lists

If brokers still don't appear after applying this fix, please check the browser console for any errors.
